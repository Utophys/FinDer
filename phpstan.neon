# phpstan.neon
includes:
    # This line is crucial for Larastan to integrate with PHPStan
    - ./vendor/larastan/larastan/extension.neon

parameters:
    # The 'level' parameter defines the strictness of the analysis.
    # Levels range from 0 (very loose) to 9 (very strict).
    # For a new Laravel 12 project, starting at level 5 or 6 is often recommended.
    # You can increase this gradually as you fix issues.
    level: 6

    # 'paths' defines which directories/files PHPStan should analyze.
    # These are common directories for a Laravel project.
    paths:
        - app/
        - database/
        - routes/
        - config/
        - tests/

    # You can optionally exclude specific paths from analysis.
    # This is useful for third-party code or files that are intentionally
    # "broken" for testing purposes.
    # excludePaths:
    #     - app/Http/Controllers/SomeLegacyController.php

    # 'ignoreErrors' allows you to ignore specific errors based on regex patterns.
    # Use this sparingly and ideally only for known false positives or
    # temporary workarounds. It's better to fix the code if possible.
    # ignoreErrors:
    #     - '#Call to an undefined method .*::doSomethingThatIsActuallyDefinedViaMagic#'
    #     # Example of ignoring an error in a specific file
    #     # - message: '#Access to an undefined property App\\\\Models\\\\User::\\$someProperty#'
    #     #   path: app/Http/Controllers/MyController.php
